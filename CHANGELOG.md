# Changelog

All notable changes to `local_oksigeniaaty` are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the plugin follows Moodle's date-based versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Designer QR codes in the site's brand: round modules in the brand colour (darkened when too light to read on
  white), rounded eyes, solid alignment patterns, and the site's logo in the middle when it covers no alignment
  pattern. Used on the personal "Open in the Aty app" page (Moodle's plain QR stays as the fallback) and on a new
  admin page, "Oksigenia Aty: site QR code", with the site's code to download as SVG for posters and letters.
- PHPUnit tests for the QR drawing, and a CI step that reads the sample codes with a real reader (zbar).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-24

The home design from the art director's common template.

### Added

- The home tab now renders a brand hero (optional white logo, heading, welcome) and the shortcuts as a two-column
  mosaic with a Font Awesome icon each and an "opens outside the app" marker for external links. The layout CSS is
  served as part of the generated app stylesheet, so it follows light and dark on its own.
- Home logo setting, and the shortcut lines now take an optional icon ("Label | https://url | fas-icon").

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-24

The per-site design works in the app: brand and home from the settings.

### Added

- The remote CSS the app loads (`mobilecssurl`) is generated from the brand colour, for light and dark mode, and
  served from `styles_app.php` (brand primary, shade, tint, contrast and the header toolbar). The plugin points
  `mobilecssurl` at it on install and when the colour changes, unless the site already set its own app CSS.
- Home shortcuts: a list of "Label | https://url" links shown as items on the home tab.
- PHPUnit tests for the CSS generator.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-24

Skeleton of the plugin.

### Added

- Plugin scaffold: `version.php`, language packs (en, es), null privacy provider and settings page.
- Per-site design settings: brand colour, home heading and home welcome.
- A home tab for the app (`CoreMainMenuHomeDelegate`) that renders the configured heading and welcome; it works in
  the official Moodle app too.
- Moodle Plugin CI, secret scan and the no-AI-signature check.
